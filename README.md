# Python-Discord-Bot
A python discord bot for *somewhere*
# Roadmap
- small optimisations to add later:
- - make it so !rym and !topster can be called by other people to show someones they are pinging
- - dont allow self stars, remove starboard post when under starboard limit
- - improve how levels are given out

# Thanks:
- w2www: for helping lots with the bot and errors that occured
